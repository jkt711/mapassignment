<div id="body"><p>Cases of a tick borne bacterial infection appear to have been concentrated around Manhattan’s Upper West and East Sides and Northwestern Brooklyn over the past 20 years, according to data from the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. </p>

<p> Between 2000 and 2018, the Upper West Side led with a total of 112 reported cases of   anaplasmosis, a bacterial infection <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/anaplasmosis/index.html"> spread primarily by the black-legged tick in the Northeast.</a>The Upper East Side and Downtown Brooklyn trail close behind at 86 and 45 reported cases respectively. </p>

<p>"Anaplasmosis is caused by Ixodes scapularis (Black-legged Tick) in our region which are becoming more and more prevalent in our region do to climate change," says Amanda Gabryzak, a Wildlife Rehabilitator who conducted tick counts on native rodents with the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Milbrook, New York. </p> 	

	
<p>The NYC Department of Health says that numbers of anaplasmosis in New York City are among the lowest in New York State, with most NYC citizens being infected while traveling abroad to prone areas. <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/advisory/2019/tick-borne-disease.pdf"> Black-legged ticks have been found in Staten Island and the Northern Bronx </a> which has led to local transmission. The disease is the second most frequent tick borne disease reported statewide,<a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/commissioner/grand_rounds/tick_borne_diseases/docs/backenson.pdf”"> according to the New York Department of Health.</a> In 2019, the NYC Department of Health issued an advisory for tick borne diseases, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/advisory/2019/tick-borne-disease.pdf"> with a 491% increase in cases seen between 2010 and 2018.</a> </p>

<p>Anaplasmosis is also most prevalent among the wealthiest communities in New York City, according to both <a href="https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ts&PopulationSource=CDSD&Topic=1&Subtopic=42">the New York Department of Health</a> and a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539797/">2015 study published in the American Journal of Public Health.</a></p> 

<p>Out of the 474 cases reported between 2005 and 2018, 51.3% occured in zip codes that the American Community Survey reported as having less than 10% of its residents living under the federal poverty level. The American Journal of Health found that anaplasmosis had the most extreme disparity between poverty levels out of all vector borne diseases in their sampling of New York City.<p>
